All information stored is temporary -unless it is public information- and will never be shared by any means. The duration depends on how long you use our service most of the time.

All information we store is Discord data that we are allowed to use. We will not ask for external information like your real name, address or anything sensitive. We do not and will never save information you did not provide.
